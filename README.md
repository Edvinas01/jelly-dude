# Jelly Dude
2d game based on soft body physics.

## Running
To build and run the game, you only need to have JDK 8 installed on your machine. After you got that ready, clone this
repository and navigate to the root project directory.

If you're on Linux run the following command
```
./gradlew run
```

And on a Windows machine
```
gradlew.bat run
```

This will download all required dependencies, build the game and launch it.
