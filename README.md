2d game based on soft body physics.

## Running
First make sure that you have JRE 8 installed. Then grab the latest game release which you can find [here](https://github.com/Edvinas01/jelly-dude/releases/latest) and after downloading, simply run the `.jar` file.

## Building
To build and run the game, you need to have JDK 8 installed on your machine. After you got that ready, clone this
repository and navigate to root project directory.

If you're on Linux run the following command
